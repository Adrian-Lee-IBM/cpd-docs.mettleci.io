# Capturing test data

Each DataStage development team will already have a set of test data that they use to verify their flow's correct operation.  DataStage enables you to capture that data (regardless of whatever technology is currently used to supply it) and encapsulate it into a commonly managed, well governed artefact which can travel with your job to repeatedly assert its consistent behaviour in any downstream environment.  This existing test data can be captured by DataStage by running a flow in 'Data Interception' mode.

This process involves running your flow in a 'Capture' mode.  In this mode DataStage will interrogate the data flowing along the input and output links referenced in your test case specification and record the data it observes into the test data file defined (by your specification) for each link.  This permits the capture of structured and unstructured data from both batch and streaming data sources.

The data flowing along a flow's output links is captured as the current definition of 'expected' output into the relevant output data files.  When you alter the flow's functionality you may well need to [re-capture a new baseline](baselining-test-results.md) of expected results.

Process

1. In the test case editor click **Intercept data**. You'll need to accept any 'Overwrite all test data' warning you receive by clicking **Intercept flow**.
1. You'll receive a message telling you the flow is running.  Select the ***Test history*** tab to browse the most recent history of test case job invocations, including jobs currently in progress.




1. In the data area above the table click the **trash** icon to delete the data file.
1. Your test specification now refers to at least one CSV data file which no longer exists. [Execute your test case](executing-a-datastage-test-case.md) without changing the specification. DataStage will identify that no expected results exist for the file(s) youâ€™ve deleted and re-create them using the data captured at runtime.  Note that test case will fail when executed in this mode.
1. Re-execute the same test case job.  DataStage will now use the new baseline results files and your test case will pass.
