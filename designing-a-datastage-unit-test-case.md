# Designing a DataStage test case

DataStageÂ® test cases are design-time assets that use data files to define the inputs and expected outputs of your DataStage flows.

Each DataStage test case is associated with a single DataStage flow. You can create DataStage test cases from the Asset browser or directly from within the DataStage designer canvas.

The basic building blocks of a test case are:
* A test specification
* One or more test data input files
* One or more test data output files

DataStage test cases are organized in projects alongside the DataStage flow to which
. To start, open an existing project or create a new project.
