# Editing a DataStage test case

You can edit DataStage test cases either from the Asset browser or directly from within the DataStage designer canvas.

From the asset browser open an existing project then under the **Asset types** panel select **DataStage components** > **Test cases** from where you can click the name of the test case you wish to edit.

From the DataStage canvas open an existing DataStage flow then click the **Test cases** icon to open up the test cases side panel from where you can click the name of the test case you wish to edit.

This will bring you to the test case editor which supports the following functions:

* Editing input or output test data
